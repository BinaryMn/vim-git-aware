To make this work, clone this repo in home directory. Then modify your .vimrc to source ~/vim-git-aware/timrc.template.

A statusbar template is also included along with some useful functions. Feel free to use it as a base in adjusting your statusbar layout.

Note, this is my own personal script. You're welcome to use it, but new features are added as it applies to my own habits and workflows.
